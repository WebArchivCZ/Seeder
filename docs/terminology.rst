Terminology
===========

If might get confusing sometimes to work with all those names.
This all seems like some very odd farming project with terms like Harvests and
seeds...

Sources
-------

Sources are sort of publications - they can have multiple seeds = URLs, they
have a publisher and they need to have assigned contract otherwise they might
not be harvested.

Seeds
-----

Seeds are just weird way how to say URL. Each seed has its own  sources.
Sources can have multiple seeds. Seeds have different rules how they can be
harvested based on technical necessities.

Voting round
------------

Process of deciding whether source should be archived or not. This process
is repeated sometimes.

Curator
-------

Somebody who checks the content of the archiving sources.
Masters of the archive.

QA check
--------

Quality assurance check that happens after source has been accepted to
archive. This is a check mainly for the content changes and technical side
of the harvesting.


Publishers
----------

They publish sources. They need to sign a contract unless they have open source
licence.

Harvests
--------

Instance of an act of downloading seeds and archiving them. Might happen
automatically in future.

Harvest blacklist
-----------------

Some publishers don't want to be their resources harvested.
So they are blacklisted. Miserable people those are.

Visibility blacklist
--------------------

Some sites are harvested but they don't have contract yet so they must not
ever be displayed on a web.
